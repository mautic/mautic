## Getting Started

The GitHub version is recommended for development or testing. Production package ready for install with all the libraries is at [https://www.mautic.org/download](https://www.mautic.org/download).

Documentation on how to use Mautic is available at [https://docs.mautic.org](https://docs.mautic.org).

This is a simple 3 step installation process. You'll want to make sure you already have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) available on your computer as this is a development release and you'll need to use Composer to download the vendor packages.

## Disclaimer
Installing from source is only recommended if you are comfortable using the command line. You'll be required to use various CLI commands to get Mautic working and to keep it working. If the source and/or database schema gets out of sync with Mautic's releases, the release updater may not work and will require manual updates. For production the pre-packaged Mautic available at [mautic.org/download](https://www.mautic.org/download) is recommended.

*Also note that the source outside <a href="https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases">a tagged release</a> should be considered "alpha" and may contain bugs, cause unexpected results, data corruption or loss, and is not recommended for use in a production environment. Use at your own risk.*
