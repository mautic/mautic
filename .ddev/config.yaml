# Key features of ddev's config.yaml:

# name: <projectname> # Name of the project, automatically provides
#   http://projectname.ddev.site and https://projectname.ddev.site

# type: <projecttype>  # drupal6/7/8, backdrop, typo3, wordpress, php

# docroot: <relative_path> # Relative path to the directory containing index.php.

# php_version: "7.4"  # PHP version to use, "5.6", "7.0", "7.1", "7.2", "7.3", "7.4", "8.0", "8.1", "8.2"

# You can explicitly specify the webimage but this
# is not recommended, as the images are often closely tied to ddev's' behavior,
# so this can break upgrades.

# webimage: <docker_image>  # nginx/php docker image.

# database:
#   type: <dbtype> # mysql, mariadb
#   version: <version> # database version, like "10.3" or "8.0"
# Note that mariadb_version or mysql_version from v1.18 and earlier
# will automatically be converted to this notation with just a "ddev config --auto"

# router_http_port: <port>  # Port to be used for http (defaults to port 80)
# router_https_port: <port> # Port for https (defaults to 443)

# xdebug_enabled: false  # Set to true to enable xdebug and "ddev start" or "ddev restart"
# Note that for most people the commands
# "ddev xdebug" to enable xdebug and "ddev xdebug off" to disable it work better,
# as leaving xdebug enabled all the time is a big performance hit.

# xhprof_enabled: false  # Set to true to enable xhprof and "ddev start" or "ddev restart"
# Note that for most people the commands
# "ddev xhprof" to enable xhprof and "ddev xhprof off" to disable it work better,
# as leaving xhprof enabled all the time is a big performance hit.

# webserver_type: nginx-fpm  # or apache-fpm

# timezone: Europe/Berlin
# This is the timezone used in the containers and by PHP;
# it can be set to any valid timezone,
# see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
# For example Europe/Dublin or MST7MDT

# composer_root: <relative_path>
# Relative path to the composer root directory from the project root. This is
# the directory which contains the composer.json and where all Composer related
# commands are executed.

# composer_version: "2"
# You can set it to "" or "2" (default) for Composer v2 or "1" for Composer v1
# to use the latest major version available at the time your container is built.
# It is also possible to use each other Composer version channel. This includes:
#   - 2.2 (latest Composer LTS version)
#   - stable
#   - preview
#   - snapshot
# Alternatively, an explicit Composer version may be specified, for example "2.2.18".
# To reinstall Composer after the image was built, run "ddev debug refresh".

# nodejs_version: "16"
# change from the default system Node.js version to another supported version, like 12, 14, 17, 18.
# Note that you can use 'ddev nvm' or nvm inside the web container to provide nearly any
# Node.js version, including v6, etc.

# additional_hostnames:
#  - somename
#  - someothername
# would provide http and https URLs for "somename.ddev.site"
# and "someothername.ddev.site".

# additional_fqdns:
#  - example.com
#  - sub1.example.com
# would provide http and https URLs for "example.com" and "sub1.example.com"
# Please take care with this because it can cause great confusion.

# upload_dir: custom/upload/dir
# would set the destination path for ddev import-files to <docroot>/custom/upload/dir
# When mutagen is enabled this path is bind-mounted so that all the files
# in the upload_dir don't have to be synced into mutagen

# working_dir:
#   web: /var/www/html
#   db: /home
# would set the default working directory for the web and db services.
# These values specify the destination directory for ddev ssh and the
# directory in which commands passed into ddev exec are run.

# omit_containers: [db, dba, ddev-ssh-agent]
# Currently only these containers are supported. Some containers can also be
# omitted globally in the ~/.ddev/global_config.yaml. Note that if you omit
# the "db" container, several standard features of ddev that access the
# database container will be unusable. In the global configuration it is also
# possible to omit ddev-router, but not here.

# nfs_mount_enabled: false
# Great performance improvement but requires host configuration first.
# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/performance/#nfs

# mutagen_enabled: false
# Performance improvement using mutagen asynchronous updates.
# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install/performance/#mutagen

# fail_on_hook_fail: False
# Decide whether 'ddev start' should be interrupted by a failing hook

# host_https_port: "59002"
# The host port binding for https can be explicitly specified. It is
# dynamic unless otherwise specified.
# This is not used by most people, most people use the *router* instead
# of the localhost port.

# host_webserver_port: "59001"
# The host port binding for the ddev-webserver can be explicitly specified. It is
# dynamic unless otherwise specified.
# This is not used by most people, most people use the *router* instead
# of the localhost port.

# host_db_port: "59002"
# The host port binding for the ddev-dbserver can be explicitly specified. It is dynamic
# unless explicitly specified.

# phpmyadmin_port: "8036"
# phpmyadmin_https_port: "8037"
# The PHPMyAdmin ports can be changed from the default 8036 and 8037

# host_phpmyadmin_port: "8036"
# The phpmyadmin (dba) port is not normally bound on the host at all, instead being routed
# through ddev-router, but it can be specified and bound.

# mailhog_port: "8025"
# mailhog_https_port: "8026"
# The MailHog ports can be changed from the default 8025 and 8026

# host_mailhog_port: "8025"
# The mailhog port is not normally bound on the host at all, instead being routed
# through ddev-router, but it can be bound directly to localhost if specified here.

# webimage_extra_packages: [php7.4-tidy, php-bcmath]
# Extra Debian packages that are needed in the webimage can be added here

# dbimage_extra_packages: [telnet,netcat]
# Extra Debian packages that are needed in the dbimage can be added here

# use_dns_when_possible: true
# If the host has internet access and the domain configured can
# successfully be looked up, DNS will be used for hostname resolution
# instead of editing /etc/hosts
# Defaults to true

# project_tld: ddev.site
# The top-level domain used for project URLs
# The default "ddev.site" allows DNS lookup via a wildcard
# If you prefer you can change this to "ddev.local" to preserve
# pre-v1.9 behavior.

# ngrok_args: --basic-auth username:pass1234
# Provide extra flags to the "ngrok http" command, see
# https://ngrok.com/docs#http or run "ngrok http -h"

# disable_settings_management: false
# If true, ddev will not create CMS-specific settings files like
# Drupal's settings.php/settings.ddev.php or TYPO3's AdditionalConfiguration.php
# In this case the user must provide all such settings.

# You can inject environment variables into the web container with:
# web_environment:
# - SOMEENV=somevalue
# - SOMEOTHERENV=someothervalue

# no_project_mount: false
# (Experimental) If true, ddev will not mount the project into the web container;
# the user is responsible for mounting it manually or via a script.
# This is to enable experimentation with alternate file mounting strategies.
# For advanced users only!

# bind_all_interfaces: false
# If true, host ports will be bound on all network interfaces,
# not just the localhost interface. This means that ports
# will be available on the local network if the host firewall
# allows it.

# default_container_timeout: 120
# The default time that ddev waits for all containers to become ready can be increased from
# the default 120. This helps in importing huge databases, for example.

#web_extra_exposed_ports:
#- name: nodejs
#  container_port: 3000
#  http_port: 2999
#  https_port: 3000
#- name: something
#  container_port: 4000
#  https_port: 4000
#  http_port: 3999
# Allows a set of extra ports to be exposed via ddev-router
# The port behavior on the ddev-webserver must be arranged separately, for example
# using web_extra_daemons.
# For example, with a web app on port 3000 inside the container, this config would
# expose that web app on https://<project>.ddev.site:9999 and http://<project>.ddev.site:9998
# web_extra_exposed_ports:
#  - container_port: 3000
#    http_port: 9998
#    https_port: 9999

#web_extra_daemons:
#- name: "http-1"
#  command: "/var/www/html/node_modules/.bin/http-server -p 3000"
#  directory: /var/www/html
#- name: "http-2"
#  command: "/var/www/html/node_modules/.bin/http-server /var/www/html/sub -p 3000"
#  directory: /var/www/html

# override_config: false
# By default, config.*.yaml files are *merged* into the configuration
# But this means that some things can't be overridden
# For example, if you have 'nfs_mount_enabled: true'' you can't override it with a merge
# and you can't erase existing hooks or all environment variables.
# However, with "override_config: true" in a particular config.*.yaml file,
# 'nfs_mount_enabled: false' can override the existing values, and
# hooks:
#   post-start: []
# or
# web_environment: []
# or
# additional_hostnames: []
# can have their intended affect. 'override_config' affects only behavior of the
# config.*.yaml file it exists in.

# Many ddev commands can be extended to run tasks before or after the
# ddev command is executed, for example "post-start", "post-import-db",
# "pre-composer", "post-composer"
# See https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/custom-commands/ for more
# information on the commands that can be extended and the tasks you can define
# for them. Example:
#hooks:
