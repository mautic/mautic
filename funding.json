The API library requires authentication via OAuth 2 or Basic Auth, depending on the Mautic installation settings.\n\nExtensive documentation accompanying the API library can be found directly within the GitHub repository or via Mautic's official developer docs at https://devdocs.mautic.org (legacy docs at https://developer.mautic.org), ensuring developers have guidance on setting up and utilizing the library effectively. \n\nThere is not currently 100% API coverage however it's a long term goal to work towards this, such that the front-end of Mautic could be entirely decoupled, enabling it to run headless if desired.",
